## 🚀 About Me

My IT journey began as a Middleware Administrator working with WebSphere Application Server, where automation through shell scripting sparked my transition into DevOps. Since then, I’ve worked across startup and enterprise environments, designing and implementing DevOps and DevSecOps practices on AWS and Azure.

I have strong hands-on experience with Kubernetes and cloud-native architectures, modernizing monolithic applications into microservices and migrating workloads from on-premises environments to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Over time, my focus expanded into data engineering and platform architecture. I’ve designed and built end-to-end cloud data platforms using medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), automated infrastructure using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines, and implemented Databricks Unity Catalog for enterprise data governance.

More recently, I’ve been working on MLOps and Generative AI platforms—building ML pipelines across Databricks, Azure Machine Learning, and Kubernetes, deploying foundation models on Azure, implementing LiteLLM for token usage monitoring and cost governance, and delivering AI agents using Power Platform and Copilot Studio.
